                <p>On 26 November 2021, WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named Omicron, on the
                    advice of WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE). This decision was based on the
                    evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how
                    it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes.</p>
